# Expanded-Emerald
A ROM hack designed with vanilla Emerald in mind.

# What isn't Expanded Emerald?
  1. This ROM does not add new generational content, such as: Pokémon, abilities, moves, held items, etc.
  2. This ROM does not include the physical/special split.
  3. Apart from adding some content that takes slight liberty with the lore, the story for Emerald remains relatively untouched.

# What **is** Expanded Emerald?
  1. Expanded Emerald is a decomp ROM hack designed to revamp the original game without changing the core experience.
  2. Expanded Emerald takes existing features, such as the Winstrate Family, and expands upon it to make it more interesting.
  3. Expanded Emerald contains many difficulty/nuzlocke knobs to allow users to customize their experience.
  4. Expanded Emerald offers a chance for the player to obtain any of the original 386 Pokémon in the cartridge, without trading.
  5. Expanded Emerald also allows most of these Pokémon to be transferred LEGALLY to future generations.
