# Expanded-Emerald
A ROM hack designed with vanilla Emerald in mind.

# What isn't Expanded Emerald?
  1. This ROM does not add new generational content, such as: Pokémon, abilities, moves, held items, etc.
  2. This ROM does not include the physical/special split.
  3. This ROM does not change the events of the main story.
